### Hey.

I'm Lucas, and I work professionally as a software engineer. I graduated in Computer Science at [UEM](http://www.uem.br/), in Brazil.

I like solving problems that are tricky in nature and which require a good dose of creativity to tackle. My interests include programming language design and implementation, game development, game design, systems programming, tooling, information security, mathematics and computer graphics, among others. I also enjoy teaching and learning new topics.
